## **Who Can Claim the Welcome Bonus?**

Any user who meets the following criteria generally qualifies:

1.  **Legal Age**: 18+ (or the minimum legal age for online gambling in your jurisdiction).

3.  **Eligible Region**: English players usually have no issues accessing the site, but double-check local laws.
4.  **First-Time Claim**: Welcome bonuses typically apply to new users or first-time depositors.

## **Avoid These Bonus Mistakes**

1.  **Ignoring Wagering Requirements**: If a bonus must be wagered 3x or 5x, ensure you satisfy that requirement before trying to withdraw.

3.  **Multiple or Duplicate Accounts**: Sites typically ban users creating multiple accounts to farm promo codes.
4.  **Withdrawal Timing**: Withdrawing too soon can nullify your bonus if you haven’t met rollover conditions.

## **Welcome Bonus Terms and Conditions**

Common T&Cs associated with welcome bonuses on CSGORoll:

*   **Wagering Minimums**: You might need to place bets totaling a specific multiple of the bonus amount.
*   **Expiration Dates**: Some bonuses or free cases expire within hours or days of being claimed.
*   **Limited Game Modes**: Not all wagers (e.g., on certain case openings or specific events) may count toward clearing wagering requirements.
*   **Withdrawal Thresholds**: A minimum site credit or skin value might be necessary before you can initiate a withdrawal.

## **CSGORoll Verification**

To enhance security and comply with anti-fraud measures, CSGORoll might request:

*   **Profile Checks**: Basic verification of your Steam ID to confirm no suspicious activity.
*   **Identity Confirmation**: In rare cases of large withdrawals or questionable logs, you may be asked to verify your personal details.
*   **Payment Method Verification**: If you deposit funds via third-party payment gateways, additional proof of ownership might be needed.

## **Wagering Requirements**

When a site mentions a 3x, 5x, or 10x wagering requirement, it indicates how many times your bonus (and sometimes your deposit) must be used in bets. For instance:

*   **Example**: A £10 bonus with a 3x wagering requirement means you need to bet a total of £30 on eligible games before those bonus funds can be withdrawn or exchanged.
*   **Game Contribution**: Check how much each game type contributes to the wagering requirement. Some might contribute 100%, while others, like certain case openings, might contribute less or none.
